Each student, will upload their work, in the branches he/she belongs.
Example:
If you are in the branched named Grupi-1, you click on it, then upload your code.
The branched named "main", is only used by the Teacher.
DO NOT FORK each-others projects, unless you worked together, in a team.
Thank you.

Sincerely,
Blerina Demaj
